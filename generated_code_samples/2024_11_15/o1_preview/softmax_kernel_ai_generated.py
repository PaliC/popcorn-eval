# When implemented naively in PyTorch, computing :code:`y = naive_softmax(x)` for :math:`x \in R^{M \times N}`
# requires reading :math:`5MN + 2M` elements from DRAM and writing back :math:`3MN + 2M` elements.
# This is obviously wasteful; we'd prefer to have a custom "fused" kernel that only reads
# X once and does all the necessary computations on-chip.
# Doing so would require reading and writing back only :math:`MN` bytes, so we could
# expect a theoretical speed-up of ~4x (i.e., :math:`(8MN + 4M) / 2MN`).
# The `torch.jit.script` flags aims to perform this kind of "kernel fusion" automatically
# but, as we will see later, it is still far from ideal.

# Compute Kernel
# --------------
#
# Our softmax kernel works as follows: each program loads a set of rows of the input matrix X strided by number of programs,
# normalizes it and writes back the result to the output Y.
#
# Note that one important limitation of Triton is that each block must have a
# power-of-two number of elements, so we need to internally "pad" each row and guard the
# memory operations properly if we want to handle any possible input shapes:

raise Exception("This file was not generated with valid python code")


# %%
# We can create a helper function that enqueues the kernel and its (meta-)arguments for any given input tensor.
