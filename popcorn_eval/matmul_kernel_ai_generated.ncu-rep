    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 8 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 132             
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the
