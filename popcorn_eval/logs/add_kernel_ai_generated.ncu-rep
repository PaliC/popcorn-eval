This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the Hardware Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for more details on launch configurations."

The difference between calculated theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (6.0%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on optimizing occupancy."
