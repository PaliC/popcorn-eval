    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required registers. This kernel's     
          theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference between      
          calculated theoretical (25.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (6.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling    
          overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within  
          a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required registers. This kernel's     
          theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference between      
          calculated theoretical (25.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (6.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling

          a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required registers. This kernel's     
          theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference between      
          calculated theoretical (25.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (6.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling    
          overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within  
          a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 64 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 132            
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (31.2%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (31.2%) and measured achieved occupancy (6.2%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 64 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 132            
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (31.2%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (31.2%) and measured achieved occupancy (6.2%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 128 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 132           
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (28.1%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (28.1%) and measured achieved occupancy (3.1%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (28.1%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (28.1%) and measured achieved occupancy (3.1%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 128 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 132           
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (28.1%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (28.1%) and measured achieved occupancy (3.1%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 128 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 132           
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (28.1%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (28.1%) and measured achieved occupancy (3.1%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (28.1%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The           
          difference between calculated theoretical (28.1%) and measured achieved occupancy (3.1%) can be the result    
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on           
          optimizing occupancy.
